Dilution Exercise Explanation - Mohit Ambe

Cx = concentration of a certain sample from rack 10
Vx = volume of a certain sample from rack 10
Vy = volume of buffer
Cz = desired concentration of the dilution in rack 7

1. solve the dilution equation for Vx
GIVEN: Cz = CxVx/Vx+Vy
Cz(Vx+Vy) = CxVx
CzVx+CzVy = CxVx
CzVy = CxVx-CzVx
CzVy = (Cx-Cz)Vx

CzVy/(Cx-Cz) = Vx

2. Vx + Vy <= 180, but we actually want Vy to be as large as possible
in order to dilute high concentrations(in the 100s and 1000s) down to only 9 ug/ml

3. to maximize Vy, set Vx+Vy equal to 180
Vx+Vy = 180

4. so, Vy = 180 - Vx, and solve for Vx again
Cz(180-Vx)/(Cx-Cz) = Vx
180-Vx = Vx(Cx-Cz)/Cz
180 = Vx(Cx-Cz)/Cz + Vx
180 = Vx( (Cx-Cz)/Cz + 1 )

180 /( (Cx-Cz)/Cz + 1 ) = Vx

this is the final equation to solve for Vx,
where Cx changes based on the sample being diluted
and Cz is always 9 ug/ml (or any other desired concentration)
