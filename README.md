## Edit dilution_exercise.py to accomplish the following
**Objective: All concentrations of the samples in column 1 of rack 7 are 9 ug/mL, where the sample in A1 of rack 7 is transferred from the sample in A1 of rack 10, etc**
Steps:
1. Transfer (a possibly variable) volume of buffer from the reservoir on rack 11.
2. Transfer (a possibly variable) amount of sample from each of A1...12 on rack 10 to the corresponding well in rack 7.

**Constraints:**
1. Each tip can only touch 1 sample (necessary to pick up and drop tips)
2. The volume taken from any well in column 1 of rack 10 is less than 25 mL.
3. The total volume in any well in column 1 of rack 7 is less than 180 mL.
